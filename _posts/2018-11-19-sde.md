We all know Theano as a forefront library for Deep Learning research. However, it should be noted that Theano is a general purpose numerical computing library, like Numpy. Hence, in this post, we will look at the implementation of PDE simulation in Theano.

<h2 class="section-heading">The Laplace Equation</h2>

We will look at a simple PDE example, the [Laplace Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace's_equation):

$$ \nabla^2 \phi = 0 $$

In other words, this is an second order PDE, as, recall that Laplacian in calculus is the divergence of gradient of a function:

$$ \nabla \cdot \nabla \phi = 0 $$

particularly, in two dimension:

$$ \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} = 0 $$

This simple equation could be solved by using Finite Difference scheme [1].

Note that in this example, we are ignoring the boundary value problem.


<h2 class="section-heading">Solving Laplace Equation in Numpy</h2>

The Finite Difference solution of Laplace Equation is to repeatedly averaging the neighbors of a particular point:

$$ \phi_{i, j} = \frac{1}{4} \left( \phi_{i+1, j} + \phi_{i+1, j} + \phi_{i, j+1} + \phi_{i, j-1} \right) $$

This iterative solution is very simple to implement in Numpy. But first, let's give this problem an initial condition:

$$ \phi = -5 \, \exp (x^2 + y^2) $$

Visualizing the function:

Now, let's implement this. First, we create the mesh, the solution space:

``` python
# Create 21x21 mesh grid
m = 21
mesh_range = np.arange(-1, 1, 2/(m-1))
x, y = np.meshgrid(mesh_range, mesh_range)

# Initial condition
U = np.exp(-5 * (x**2 + y**2))
```

We then create an indexing scheme that select the point north, west, south, and east of any given point. We do this so that we could implement this in vectorized manner.
